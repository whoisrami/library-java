Code Portfolio
================

###Please read this first.  
This repository contains a collection of Algorithms, Data Structures, and more implemented in various languages.
I am steadily adding to this repository as often as possible, to demonstrate my ability with various computer science concepts, study for technical interviews, as well to provide potential recruiters with some code to look at when considering me for an opening.

This repository is structured so that one can easily find structured, readable snippets of code written by myself, to get a feel for the way I code, in addition to being my personal study material.


###Be nice.
As I am currently still a full-time student, juggling several classes and a part-time job, as well as being an officer in student orgs, it is difficult for me to maintain the code quality of all the repositories being displayed in my GitHub account as much as I would like.

Please, take what you see in some of my other repositories with a grain of salt and realize that they may have been outdated school projects, learning experiences, or even hackathon code which I have not had the time to update yet.  Thanks!
