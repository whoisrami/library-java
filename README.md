Code Portfolio
================

###Read this First  
This repository contains a collection of Algorithms, Data Structures, and more implemented in various languages.
I am steadily adding to this repository as often as possible, to demonstrate my ability with various computer science concepts, study for technical interviews, as well to provide potential recruiters with some code to look at when considering me for an opening.

This repository is structured so that one can easily find structured, readable snippets of code written by myself, to get a feel for the way I code, in addition to being my personal study material.


###Disclaimer
I am currently still a full-time student, juggling several classes, a job, as well as being an officer in student orgs, so it is difficult for me to maintain the code quality of all the other repositories being displayed in my GitHub account as much as I would like.

**Please, take what you see in some of my other repositories/old commits with a grain of salt** and realize that they may(likely but not necessarily) have been outdated course projects, learning experimentations, or even hackathon code which I have not had the chance to update yet.  Thanks! 

Please feel free check out my page at [aly006.github.io](aly006.github.io) to see some descriptions of my past work experience.
